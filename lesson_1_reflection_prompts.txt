How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It identified the differences in an easy to read manner so I did not have to eyeball both files line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You can use the versions to see how coding style evolved and was made more efficient over time.
The code or code style can be re-used in other projects.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pro - There are limited versions, and only when you requested them, so less filtering to see when affecting changes were made.

Con - If you forget to save a version, the program shuts down or the computer crashes, you will lose changes if they are not made in a local program that auto-saves.
It's best to use an auto-saving local program along with a version control system like GIT or SVN.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

This is due to the type of files.
In Google Docs and other such systems the files are static pages like word processing, images, spreadsheets, etc.

In Git and other systems like SVN the files are interrelated and the changes should to be applied together else functionality updated may not work as expected or not at all.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows you to see when the changes were made and if --stat is used, how many changes (lines added or deleted)
git diff allows you to see what exactly was changed over time between different versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Because you can go back and see when and where the code was broken to easily repair the issue.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I have multiple projects in various languages that I would like to store here.
Building maps with dropdowns and customizations
Android apps
