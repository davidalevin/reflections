Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is clone of a repository that is then added to your list of repositories on Github.
Clone is a local version of a remote repository - owner is not specific.

stored locally?

So you know if there have been any changes done outside of the local version of the repository.
