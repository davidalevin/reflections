When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When multiple users need to make updates.
When you are not working on 1 fixed device.
Addition to show how to use pull from Guthub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes on Github due to muliple users, changes from multiple devices, etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is clone of a repository that is then added to your list of repositories on Github.
Clone is a local version of a remote repository - owner is not specific.
Branch is an added path on a repository which can have differences from the master/main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

So you know if there have been any changes done outside of the local version of the repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Save to a shared location (SharePoint, physical or cloud based server)
Face to face, via telephone, email other electronic means of communication.
Pro - Talking about it first helps others to understand why the change is being made rather than them reviewing and then having to ask why the change is being done via Github.
Con - If communication is not possible, others may overwrite due to time constraints rather than waiting for responses.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
