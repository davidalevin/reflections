What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the location for the repository.
Without it, the repository does not exist for versioning.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an interim location used prior to committing code/files to the repository whereas the working directory is the local version of code/file.
It allows for not only creation of new files, but new paths which can grow the overall functionality of whatever is being worked.
